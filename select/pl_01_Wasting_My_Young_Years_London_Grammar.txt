You crossed this line
Do you find it hard to sit with me tonight
I've walked these miles
But I've walked them straight lined
You'll never know what it's like to be
Fine
I'm wasting my young years
It doesn't matter if
I'm chasing old ideas
It doesn't matter if
Maybe, we are, we are
Maybe, I'm wasting my young years
Maybe, we are, we are
Maybe, I'm wasting my young years
Don't you know that it's only Tear
I wouldn't worry, you have all your life
I've heard it takes some time to get it right
I'm wasting my young years
It doesn't matter if
I'm chasing old ideas
It doesn't matter if
Maybe, we are, we are
Maybe, I'm wasting my young years
Maybe, we are, we are
Maybe, I'm wasting my young years
I don't know what you are
Don't leave me hanging on
Don't know what you are
Don't leave me hanging on
